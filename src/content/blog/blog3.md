Lists are a fantastic tool for organizing information in a structured manner. Markdown offers two types of lists: ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted).

#### Unordered List:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

#### Ordered List:


1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step


Lists can be nested as well, allowing for hierarchical structuring of content.

That's the beauty of Markdownâ€”it's a simple and efficient way to format your content with various features like code blocks, blockquotes, and lists to make your writing more engaging and informative.
