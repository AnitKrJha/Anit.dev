In this blog post, we'll dive deep into the solutions for Week 2 of your Java NPTEL course. These challenges will help you grasp more advanced concepts in Java programming. Let's tackle each question efficiently while keeping our code clean and concise.

## Java Week 2: Q1 - Calling 'print()' Using Inner Classes

In this problem, we have an outer class `School` and an inner class `Student`. To call the `print()` method in the `Student` class, you can create an object of the inner class and use it to invoke the `print()` method. Here's the solution:

```java
class School {
    class Student {
        public void print() {
            System.out.println("Hi! I am inner class STUDENT of outer class SCHOOL.");
        }
    }
}

public class Question211 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        School.Student s1 = new School().new Student();
        s1.print();
    }
}
```

Explanation: We create an object of the inner class `Student` using `School.Student s1 = new School().new Student();` and then call the `print()` method on this object.

## Java Week 2: Q2 - Calling Methods of Different Classes

In this question, we have two separate classes, `School` and `Student`, each with its own `print()` method. To call these methods, you can create objects of the respective classes and invoke their `print()` methods. Here's the solution:

```java
class School {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Hi! I am class SCHOOL.");
    }
}

class Student {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Hi! I am class STUDENT");
    }
}

public class Question212 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student stu = new Student();
        stu.print();

        School sch = new School();
        sch.print();
    }
}
```

Explanation: We create objects of both the `Student` and `School` classes and then call their respective `print()` methods.

## Java Week 2: Q3 - Calling Methods by Creating a New Method

In this question, you need to call the `print()` method of class `Question` by creating a method named `studentMethod()`. Here's the solution:

```java
public class Question213 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Question213 q = new Question213();
        q.studentMethod();
    }

    void print(Question213 object) {
        System.out.print("Well Done!");
    }

    void studentMethod() {
        Question213 q = new Question213();
        q.print(q);
    }
}
```

Explanation: We create an object of the `Question213` class and call the `studentMethod()`, which in turn calls the `print()` method of the same class.

## Java Week 2: Q4 - Calling Constructors in a Specific Order

This question involves calling constructors in a specific order in the `Answer` class. We create an object of the `Answer` class with the appropriate constructor. Here's the solution:

```java
public class Question214 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Answer a = new Answer(10, "MCQ");
    }
}

class Answer {
    Answer() {
        System.out.println("You got nothing.");
    }

    Answer(int marks, String type) {
        this();
        System.out.println("You got " + marks + " for an " + type);
    }
}
```

Explanation: We create an object of the `Answer` class using the constructor with parameters, which in turn calls the default constructor using `this()`.

## Java Week 2: Q5 - Debugging to Print 'NPTEL JAVA'

This question requires debugging to print the text 'NPTEL JAVA.' Here's the corrected solution:

```java
public class Question215 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare variables with names 'nptel', 'space', and 'java' with proper data types.
        String nptel, space, java;

        // Initialize the variables with proper input
        nptel = "NPTEL";
        space = " ";
        java = "JAVA";

        // Print the desired output
        System.out.print(nptel + space + java);
    }
}
```

Explanation: The code declares and initializes three strings and then prints them concatenated with spaces to get the desired output 'NPTEL JAVA.'
