### **Why Am I Writing This?**

Today, I decided to switch up my Fedora GRUB2 theme. After sifting through tutorial after tutorial and restarting my computer a whopping 12 times, I think I've finally cracked the code on the correct way to do it. So let's dive right in! ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è

### **Things You Would Need**

Before we start, let's ensure you've got everything handy:

- **Follow Instructions Carefully:** No skipping steps allowed! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Grab a Grub Theme:** You'll need one from [Gnome-Look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=109&ord=rating). Surprise, surprise!
- **Familiarity with Command Line:** Get a bit cozy with it.
- **Patience is Key:** I'll walk you through each step in detail.

### **Step 0: Try <b class="text-green-600">using grub-customizer</b> first**

If that does not work then  ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

### **Step 1: Downloading a Grub Theme**

First things first, head to [Gnome-Look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=109&ord=rating) and pick a theme you fancy. Most likely, it'll be in an archive file.

Once downloaded, double-click to extract it.

Now pop open the terminal and write

```bash
sudo cp -r /path/to/extracted/theme /boot/grub2/themes
```

Replace `/path/to/extracted/theme` with the actual path to the extracted theme folder.

This command will copy the entire extracted theme folder to the `/boot/grub2/themes` directory using the `sudo` command for administrative privileges.

> It's important to note that when using the command line, you need to specify the correct paths to ensure the theme folder is a accurately copied to the designated GRUB themes directory. Adjust the path accordingly based on where the theme is extracted.

Congrats! You've aced a major step. Now, just stick to my commands religiously.

### **Step 2: Editing the Grub Config**

Time to play with some configs! Open the terminal and access `/etc/default/grub` using your favorite editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Your file should mirror this:

```plaintext
GRUB_TIMEOUT="10"
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_DEFAULT="saved"
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU="true"
#GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet"
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG="true"

export GRUB_COLOR_NORMAL="light-gray/black"
export GRUB_COLOR_HIGHLIGHT="magenta/black"
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub2/themes/<YOUR-THEME>/theme.txt"
```

> **Simply Replace `<your-theme>` with your actual theme folder name**

This file controls Fedora's `grub.cfg` generation, which is crucial for booting.

---

### **Step 3: Generating the Grub.Cfg File**

Almost there! Run this commands:

```bash
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

> üö´üö´ Don't run this command ` sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg` because this file is meant not to be touched after **fedora 33**

**Reboot**

### **You're Welcome If It Helped You** üòé

Remember, it's all about patience and precision! If you're having a blast customizing your Fedora GRUB2, then my mission here is accomplished. Happy theming!
