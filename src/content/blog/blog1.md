In the world of programming, code blocks are an essential tool for sharing and explaining code snippets. Markdown makes it easy to include code blocks in your documents. To create a code block, simply wrap your code in triple backticks (\```) and specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

Markdown also supports inline code, like `var x = 10;`, which is great for emphasizing specific code elements.
