In the world of programming, code blocks are an essential tool for sharing and explaining code snippets. Markdown makes it easy to include code blocks in your documents. To create a code block, simply wrap your code in triple backticks (\```) and specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.

```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        cout>>"hello";
    }
}
```

Markdown also supports inline code, like `var x = 10;`, which is great for emphasizing specific code elements.
